    <h1>on the eve of depression</h1>
    <p>I call my name, I plead</p>
    <p>in quiet desperation, I try to stay afloat,</p>
    <p>I let my mind strike an arrow in a danger zone of imagination:</p>
    <p>the waves as cover to my fear,</p>
    <p>and then I squeeze my pain like a nettle in my palm</p>
    <p>and breathe for just a fleeting moment.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I see it clearly: my first ride without side wheels,</p>
    <p>the spring has yet to settle its warmer palms into April’s edges.</p>
    <p>My parents’ cheerful encouragement is bright, and my bruised knees don’t hurt as bleeding</p>
    <p>is not the only pain I’ve learnt to feel by now.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I see my heart be gently broken and I break someone else’s heart —</p>
    <p>I hate myself for that,</p>
    <p>I hate myself,</p>
    <p>I’m back,</p>
    <p>I’m back to drowning.</p>
    <p>The rapid flow of sorrow is fitting between my ribs like a habit I hoped I buried before.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I call my name again.</p>
    <p>My entire body is shivering in a steamed bathroom, I hold onto the cold of sink</p>
    <p>and I’m sinking again,</p>
    <p>the ringing in my ears gets quieter —</p>
    <p>I feel it.</p>
    <p>Feel the tickling dark to move from the back of my head towards my temples,</p>
    <p>it puts its palm on my weakest shoulder —</p>
    <p>the one I keep for all my loved ones to lean on.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I never let myself to weep,</p>
    <p>although my face is hot and wet from streams of anguish I cannot keep inside.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I picture my younger self in the greatest pain on a hallway floor while nurse</p>
    <p>hesitates and joins in lulling —</p>
    <p>she calls my name, she pleads.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I’m picturing myself with my head and bloodstream full of meds be let outside to only snap again</p>
    <p>and act as my worst enemy once more:</p>
    <p>my wrists and arms are witnesses to that.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My wild violence towards myself</p>
    <p>is what will feed the fear and self-destructive thoughts I act upon.</p>
    <p>I’m bored and that’s my sadness’ strongest drug.</p>
