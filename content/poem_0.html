    <h1>Title</h1>
    <p>one day I catch serendipity. </p>
    <p>between an almost slipping summer,</p>
    <p>when warmth of mornings has turned into </p>
    <p>the burning nature —</p>
    <p>in the continuation of the time I rupture. </p>
    <p>you cut off the tremble of the thousands </p>
    <p>unilluminated nights —</p>
    <p>though I might have fallen</p>
    <p>into the comfort of your arms like a safety net too swiftly. </p>
    <p>you fit me when I allow myself to hold you back, </p>
    <p>allow myself — through the tumbling roads and loud crowds </p>
    <p>— uncover dust to saturate myself again. </p>
    <p>and I lay beside you. </p>
    <p>can I please stay a little longer?</p>
