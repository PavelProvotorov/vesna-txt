“Ant colony in my female body.”
=============
Womanhood is like the blue whale,

with all of its 170 tonnes

crashing my bones,

and I’m rushing

to change the way I look to look attractive to men I don’t care to look attractive for.

I mourn my longer hair because coworker said he liked

the girls with longer hair;

unnecessary, unfair.

I crave with utmost hunger to be

routinely desired because we’re taught

from younger age to hide all

seemingly revolting parts

branded by societal voice that keeps on ringing in our head

like an alarm I put on snooze.

And I wake up in bed with doubtful excuse

that scratch my body like the crumbs of shame underneath my tailbone.

Comparison is women’s hunger we cannot satiate

because the thinnest waist is what’s desired to be served on a plate.

I remember being fifteen and

losing my crown of femininity —

twenty inches of my hair are gone.

And my male best friend

had looked me up and down,

“You won’t be pretty for the boys.”

But do I have to?

Now certainly I do.

(Another unnecessary noise).

I look into the mirror a dozen times per day

and then I don’t.

I avoid reflection like looking at myself would turn me into a stone,

and there’s a tonne

of skipped meals

and clothes dragged along my body,

haphazardly changing sizes, making myself

fit into the smallest one they made for bodies that aren’t mine.

I apologise for looking tired and not my best;

Like scratching another lottery ticket and the cause of lost are

shame and self-destruction.

Womanhood is like a colony of ants:

building and pleasing, building and pleasing,

having to fit my role

and the sole

purpose is to keep on growing roots into

love and self-respect —

my most authentic self

I save and never purposely dilute

for someone’s gaze and decadence.
