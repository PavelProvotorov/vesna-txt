"Untitled Poem"
=============
one day I catch serendipity.

between an almost slipping summer,

when warmth of mornings has turned into

the burning nature —

in the continuation of the time I rupture.

you cut off the tremble of the thousands

unilluminated nights —

though I might have fallen

into the comfort of your arms like a safety net too swiftly.

you fit me when I allow myself to hold you back,

allow myself — through the tumbling roads and loud crowds

— uncover dust to saturate myself again.

and I lay beside you.

can I please stay a little longer?
