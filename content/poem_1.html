    <h1>“Ant colony in my female body.”</h1>
    <p>Womanhood is like the blue whale,</p>
    <p>with all of its 170 tonnes</p>
    <p>crashing my bones,</p>
    <p>and I’m rushing</p>
    <p>to change the way I look to look attractive to men I don’t care to look attractive for.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I mourn my longer hair because coworker said he liked</p>
    <p>the girls with longer hair;</p>
    <p>unnecessary, unfair.</p>
    <p>I crave with utmost hunger to be</p>
    <p>routinely desired because we’re taught</p>
    <p>from younger age to hide all</p>
    <p>seemingly revolting parts</p>
    <p>branded by societal voice that keeps on ringing in our head</p>
    <p>like an alarm I put on snooze.</p>
    <br>
    <p>And I wake up in bed with doubtful excuse</p>
    <p>that scratch my body like the crumbs of shame underneath my tailbone.</p>
    <p>Comparison is women’s hunger we cannot satiate</p>
    <p>because the thinnest waist is what’s desired to be served on a plate.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I remember being fifteen and</p>
    <p>losing my crown of femininity —</p>
    <p>twenty inches of my hair are gone.</p>
    <p>And my male best friend</p>
    <p>had looked me up and down,</p>
    <p>“You won’t be pretty for the boys.”</p>
    <p>But do I have to?</p>
    <p>Now certainly I do.</p>
    <p>(Another unnecessary noise).</p>
    <br>
    <p>I look into the mirror a dozen times per day</p>
    <p>and then I don’t.</p>
    <p>I avoid reflection like looking at myself would turn me into a stone,</p>
    <p>and there’s a tonne</p>
    <p>of skipped meals</p>
    <p>and clothes dragged along my body,</p>
    <p>haphazardly changing sizes, making myself</p>
    <p>fit into the smallest one they made for bodies that aren’t mine.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I apologise for looking tired and not my best;</p>
    <p>Like scratching another lottery ticket and the cause of lost are</p>
    <p>shame and self-destruction.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Womanhood is like a colony of ants:</p>
    <p>building and pleasing, building and pleasing,</p>
    <p>having to fit my role</p>
    <p>and the sole</p>
    <p>purpose is to keep on growing roots into</p>
    <p>love and self-respect —</p>
    <p>my most authentic self</p>
    <p>I save and never purposely dilute</p>
    <p>for someone’s gaze and decadence.</p>
